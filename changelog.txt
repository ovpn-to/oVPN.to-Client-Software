+ user-id selection menu on start: create more user-id folders manually in '%install%\appdata\ovpn\45321'
+ removed server entry from systray: leftclick on systray icon opens serverwindow
+ leftclick systray opens serverwindow and leftclick again sends serverwindow to HIDE (keep window data in memory).

+ wait ~30s on start for interface to come up

+ may be portbale now, if you place a folder "appdata" into extracted 'dist' folder and start open_client.exe as admin manually.
+ fixed problem with systraymenu not working after updating to new Sweden Servers because of missing countryname for group...
you can fix problem by deleting files SE1.ovpn.to.ovpn + SE2.ovpn.to.ovpn from '%appdata%\ovpn\xxxxx\openvpn\config\' -> folders 'ip4' and 'ip46/' and don't update configs anymore... bug of sudden death!
